<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h3>

<p>I am Russian programmer.<br> I was born in 1986. In 2003 finished school and come to my local State University. At the same time I also found great job in our local ISP, I become system administrator. Since 2000 or 2001 I learned FreeBSD and Linux, and this my knowledge become very useful for my new job. Few years later I become senior system administrator and later IT department manager. Also I finished Univesity and got Programmer's degree. </p>

<p>But my programming road begins significant early...</p>

<a id="how-i-become-programmer" class="anchor" href="#how-i-become-programmer" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How I become programmer</h3>

<p>When I was 6..8 months ago, my father (electrician and radio hobbyists build her first computer named "Specialist" (Специалист). This computer was based on КР580ВМ80А CPU (it's russian analogue of intel 8080), had 32kb or RAM. I don't remember this computer, because I was too little, but my father doesn't stop on it. He was build 6 or 7 Spectrum clones. And oneday, when I was about 5 years old, my father showed me Basic language. He was show me how to draw cirle o screen, how to change border color and make loops. After it I started to study programming. Few years later we bought out first IBM PC. It was 80386 SX 40Mhz. Firstly I programmed in QBasic, later Turbo Basic. Later dad bought book about Pascal language for me, and I started to programm in Turbo Pascal.
Later Microsoft released windows 95, and few years later I opened for self Visual Basic. It was super for me. But later I opened Borland Delphi. It was more flexible than Visual Basic, but I loved VB's form constructor. In begin of 200x I returned from GUI to console and programmed for a long time 32bit console applications on Virtual Pascal. Later I switched to Free Pascal, because I switched to Unix systems. It was a great time.... Later I tried to begin in C and C++, but opened for self Perl. It was like magic for me. I begin to programm in Perl, and made first tries to make dynamic websites. Until I not finished school I make few sites, including School's site, but no one of those, was not published. School's site was ahead of time, it was contains e-diary with student's scores, but for school it's was difficult to maintain such service.
Few Years later I started to discover world of embedded programming. I programmed in C for AVR MCU. Later for ARM7 and later for ARM Coretex. After that, I very loved ANSI C. Later I made few hard projects in ANSI C, one of which was served thousands of simultaneous users, and found few disadvantages of this language. In seeking for alternative I dicovered Erlang. </p>

<p>Erlang is a perfect language. If you can't do something in Erlang, you can write it in C and link it with erlang application. Last few years I programming mostly in Erlang.</p>

<p>If you would like to contact me, you can contact me over XMPP: <a href="mailto:viruzzz@liveim.org">viruzzz@liveim.org</a> or you can find more contacts in my github profile.</p>
